# Enables the Spring Domain Crudify built-in security environment.
# Passing this option is not enough to disable Spring Security as it just indicates that your API will implements its own security layer and will not use the Spring Domain Crudify built-in one.

#     - the data access object which is DB dependant 
#     - a class of type AbstractSpringCrudifyUserDetails which contains the technical object used to authenticate the user
#     - a bean of type AbstractSpringCrudifyDaoAuthenticationUserMapper which implements the mapping between your business object in the database, and the technical object used to authenticate the user
